    "description": "\n\nJust finished a documented Majora's Mask soundfont with audio extracted from the Nintendo 64 version using SubDrag's Nintendo 64 Soundbank Tool V2. I have to thank SubDrag for all the hard work he's put in to making the audio files from games like Majora's Mask so accessible, really solid work.\n\nThe Soundfont file contains game audio including all instruments, percussion, ambience, and some NPC sounds categorized by bank number. Should contain about 97-98% of all in-game audio, I consider it complete.\n\nHere is a demonstration song using several instruments from the soundfont.\nMajora's Incarnation played back using the soundfont, sounds just about 1:1.\n\nIndividual extracted audio files can be downloaded here.\nAll Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask MIDI sequences can be downloaded here.\n\nDupe checks have been performed, but some duplicate presets may exist. Specs are as follows:\n\nSize: 17.1mb\n\nAudio specs:\n\n233 Instruments\n16 bit audio\nSample rate: 32000\nMono\n\n\nStructure:\n\nBank 0: Instruments\nBank 6: NPC\nBank 7: Steps\nBank 8: Ambient\nBank 9: Nature\nBank 10: Percussion\n\n\nBank 0: Instruments\n\n0:01 ACCORDION\n0:02 ACCORDION 1\n0:03 BANJO\n0:04 BASS\n0:05 BASS 1 (*Evan's bass*)*   *\n0:06 BASS 4\n0:07 BASS STACCATO\n0:08 BASSOON\n0:09 BELL CLOCK TOWER DISTANT\n0:10 BELL CLOCK TOWER\n0:11 BELL INCORRECT\n0:12 CHOIR FEMALE\n0:13 CHOIR MALE\n0:14 CONTRA\n0:15 DARK MARIM\n0:16 DARK PAD 1\n0:17 DEKU PIPE\n0:18 DUC\n0:19 ELECTRIC ORGAN\n0:20 FANTASIA\n0:21 FIDDLE\n0:22 FINAL HOURS\n0:23 FRENCH HORN\n0:24 GARY NUMAN\n0:25 GERUDO\n0:26 GIANT\n0:27 GLOCKENSPIEL\n0:28 GLOCKENSPIEL 1\n0:29 GORON\n0:30 GORON BABY\n0:31 GORON DRUM\n0:32 HARMONIC\n0:33 HARP\n0:34 HARP 2\n0:35 HARPSICHORD\n0:36 HELL YEAH\n0:37 LENS OF TRUTH\n0:38 MAJORA LEAD\n0:39 MALON\n0:40 MARIM\n0:41 MARIMBA 1\n0:42 MARIMBA GORON\n0:43 MONKEY\n0:44 NYLON GUITAR\n0:45 NYLON GUITAR 1\n0:46 OBOE\n0:47 OBOE 1\n0:48 OBOE 3\n0:49 OCARINA\n0:50 OCARINA STAC\n0:51 ORGAN\n0:52 PAD ELECTRIC\n0:53 PAD FREQUENCY\n0:54 PAD SAGES\n0:55 PAD SWIRL\n0:56 PANPIPE\n0:57 PIANO\n0:58 PIANO DET\n0:59 PIZZICATO\n0:60 STEEL DRUM\n0:61 STEEL GUITAR\n0:62 STRING PAD\n0:63 STRING SYNTH HEALING\n0:64 STRING SYNTH DECAY\n0:65 STRINGS\n0:66 TAMBUR\n0:67 THEY BASS\n0:68 THEY PAD\n0:69 TIMPANI ORCHEST\n0:70 TRUMPET\n0:71 TRUMPET 1\n0:72 TRUMPET 2\n0:73 TRUMPET 3\n0:74 VIBRAPHONE\n0:75 WHISTLE\n0:76 WHISTLE HALT\n0:77 WHOA\n0:78 ZORA GUITAR\n0:79 ZORA GUITAR 1\n0:80 PIANO DECAY\n\n\nBank 6: NPC\n\n6:01 NPC ZAP\n6:02 NPC DOG\n6:03 NPC DODONGO\n6:04 NPC EPONA\n6:05 NPC EPONA GALLOP\n6:06 NPC ENEMY STEP\n6:07 NPC KEESE\n6:08 NPC WASH\n6:09 NPC STALCHILD\n\n\nBank 7: Steps\n\n7:00 STEP WOOD\n7:01 STEP GRASS\n7:02 STEP WATER\n7:03 STEP WATER 1\n7:04 STEP STONE 1\n7:05 STEP STONE 2\n7:06 STEP SNOW\n7:07 STEP STONE\n\n\nBank 8: Ambient\n\n8:01 AMB SKID\n8:02 AMB CROWD\n8:03 AMBIENCE FINAL HOURS\n8:04 AMB SHUFFLE 1\n8:05 AMB GLASS\n8:06 AMB CLOCK BIRD\n8:07 AMB GHOST PAD\n8:08 AMB ZIPPER\n8:09 AMB CAVE\n8:10 AMB CAPE\n8:11 AMB ENGINE\n8:12 AMB SLAM\n8:13 AMB ENGINE 1\n8:14 AMB FLAME\n8:15 AMB FIRE\n8:16 AMB UNDERWATER\n8:17 AMB DROPLET\n8:18 AMB ELECTRIC\n8:19 AMB STRAY FAIRY\n8:20 AMB LIGHT\n8:21 AMB DOOR\n8:22 AMB LIGHT 1\n8:23 AMB WATER ENTER\n8:24 AMB DARK WIND\n8:25 AMB GATE OPEN\n8:26 AMB CAULDRON\n8:27 AMB DIG\n8:28 AMB METAL DOOR\n8:29 AMB WATER\n8:30 AMB BOMB\n8:31 AMB DOOR 2\n8:32 AMB CLOCK TICK\n8:33 AMB ELECTRIC 1\n8:34 AMB DARK PAD\n8:35 AMB ARROW HIT\n8:36 AMB EVIL\n8:37 AMB BOW DRAW\n8:38 AMB SLASH\n8:39 AMB SHARP\n8:40 AMB SHEATHE\n8:41 AMB SWORD HIT 1\n8:43 AMB STRAY FAIRY 1\n8:45 AMB UNDERWATER 1\n8:46 AMB WIND HEAVY\n8:47 AMB DARK NOISE\n8:48 AMB WATERFALL\n8:55 AMB DOOR OPEN BIG\n8:56 PERC SNARE 3\n8:57 AMB MARKET\n8:58 AMB WATERFALL 1\n8:60 AMB GERUDO SWING\n8:61 AMB HORROR\n\n\nBank 9: Nature\n\n9:01 NAT BIRD 6\n9:02 NAT OCEAN\n9:03 NAT FROG 1\n9:04 NAT THUNDER\n9:05 NAT THUNDER 1\n9:06 NAT RAIN\n9:07 NAT WIND 1\n9:08 NAT FROG\n9:09 NAT CRICKETS\n9:10 NAT BIRD\n9:11 NAT OWL\n9:12 NAT CUCCO CROW\n9:13 NAT BIRD 1\n9:14 NAT CROW\n9:15 NAT CHICK\n9:16 NAT CROW 1\n9:17 NAT BIRD 2\n9:18 NAT CRICKET\n9:19 NAT BIRD 3\n9:20 NAT BIRD 4\n9:21 NAT BIRD 5\n9:22 NAT CUCCO\n9:23 NAT CUCCO 1\n\n\nBank 10: Percussion\n\n10:01 PERC SHUFFLE\n10:02 PERC CLOCK TOWN 1\n10:03 PERC DEKU PALACE\n10:04 PERC SKULL KID\n10:05 PERC COW BELL\n10:06 PERC DISTANCE\n10:07 PERC CLOCK TOWN\n10:08 PERC LOW SW\n10:09 PERC WET\n10:10 PERC MOTION\n10:11 PERC DRIVE\n10:12 PERC WOOD\n10:13 PERC EXOTIC\n10:14 PERC DESERT\n10:15 PERC WOODFALL YELL\n10:16 PERC WOODFALL\n10:17 PERC WHIP (*Woodfall Temple percussion*)\n10:18 PERC MELODIC\n10:19 PERC AFRICA\n10:20 PERC SOFT (*Woodfall Temple percussion*)\n10:21 PERC KRAFTWERK\n10:22 PERC BOMBER SPIT\n10:23 PERC CRACK\n10:24 PERC CUICA GORON\n10:25 PERC LOW DRUM\n10:26 PERC SLAM 1\n10:27 PERC SWORDSMAN 1\n10:28 PERC SECRET SHRINE\n10:29 PERC POP\n10:30 PERC DISTANT\n10:31 PERC NA\n10:32 PERC ODD\n10:33 PERC THUD\n10:34 PERC EXOTIC 1\n10:35 PERC SKULL KID 2\n10:36 PERC POP 1\n10:37 PERC TIGHT\n10:38 PERC SMITHY\n10:39 PERC SWORDSMAN\n10:40 PERC SKULL KID 1\n10:41 PERC KOTAKE KOUME\n10:42 PERC KOTAKE KOUME 1\n10:43 PERC SNARE\n10:44 PERC CRASH\n10:45 PERC TIMPANI\n10:46 PERC TIMPANI 1\n10:47 PERC SMALL\n10:48 PERC BANKER\n10:49 PERC SNARE 2\n10:50 PERC SNARE EXOTIC\n10:51 PERC ZORA RIDE\n10:52 PERC HI HAT OPEN\n10:53 PERC SNARE STICK\n10:54 PERC BASS DRUM\n10:56 PERC SNARE MILK BAR\n10:57 PERC ZORA SHAKER\n10:59 PERC SNARE EXOTIC 1\n10:60 PERC SNARE 1\n10:61 PERC TAMBOURINE\n10:62 PERC AMB\n\n",

Instead of needing to create separate tracks for each voice, this SoundFont puts all the different sounds within the range of an 88-key keyboard.\n\nBuilt into this SoundFont are three Pulse (Square) wave varients, as well as Triangle and Noise wave sounds. Also included are various effects that will alter the release and pitch of each melodic voice. \n\nTechnical Info: 44.100 kHz/16 Bit Audio Format (WAV); 24 KB on Disk\n",

This soundfont is something that I found (with no sign of author or any metadata) in a forum thread with a collection of orchestral sounds and edited it to create a similar sound of voices swelling in volume.\n\nYou'll find voice aahs and oohs, a mix of both slow and immediate attack versions of the sounds. See the demo included below for a taste of the sound.\n\nHave fun!\n",

    "description": "This package contains three versions of Timidity: 2.12, 2.13 and 2.14. All of them are Windows executables with win32++ GUI.I uploaded the Windows versions because they are easy-to-use, they run nicely under Wine and the win32 GUI's have many more options than Linux GUI's (maybe even more options than Linux command line version). So you can run it on Windows, Linux and maybe even at OSx using Wine. You can even make Timidity win32 GUI your default midi player on Linux configuring the \"open with\" option of your desktop environment. (I did it and I'm very glad with it.) You'll find the timidity.cfg files that I use under wine and they may serve as examples for you. (In Linux paths use / but if you'll run it on Windows use \\ on paths.)It's nice to have different versions of Timidity because they work differently. For example from 2.13 on many instruments are played completely panned to left or right, even if they're not designed to do so, but it doesn't happen at 2.12. 2.12 also has a very easier way to write the cfg file. On the other hand that are some instruments that are rendered better in 2.13 or 2.14. And if you want to use several soundfonts and several banks, probably you'll want to spend more time with the more complicated but more flexible cfg files of 2.13 and 2.14.So, have a lot of fun.\n",

It has a default preset at bank 0 program 46 and also two presets at bank 1, program 45 for muted harp (without sustain) and program 46 is the same as the bank 0 preset.\nCurrently it's the free harp soundbank with the biggest number of good quality samples that I found online and it really sounds fine.\n",

    "description": "Good mix of samples of different objects being struck, organized as instruments presets and also as a drumkit.\n\nHammersound Rating: 9.5 / 4 reviews\n\nHammersound Description:\n\nScrapes, bangs, drilling, and metallic noises. This is quite a lot different than your typical drumkit, so if you're looking for something unique, then get this one. All original samples. I'm interested in comments. \n",

Many of the instruments sound generic or you might have \nheard them on other such GM collections, also volume is not always consistent between instruments.\n\nIt has many different drumkit presets and overall might be useful to someone.\n\nHammersound Rating: 10.0 / 3 reviews\n\nHammersound Description:\n\nVery Big! 100% Excellence overall!!!!!! This is the only one you wil ever need!\n",

    "description": "Darlings.gx.Last update July 2016. Enhanced and improved.Clean (cl), crunchy (cr) and overdriven (od) guitarix sets of Roland JC-120, Voxes, Fenders, Marshall JCM-800, Mesa Boogie.The clean sounds with reverb (rv) and a bit chorus (ch). The overdriven sounds sometimes with compression (co).Normally I prefer the tonestack, but sometimes the amp impulse seems to do a better job. Try it yourself. And try putting it in front of or behind the valve section. It sounds different!Kept simple. Just Valve - Amp Impulse or Tonestack - Reverb - Chorus - Cabinet. Now (July 2016) with tremolo Fenders.\n",

    "description": "The VirtuOrgan soundfont by Fernando A. Martin is based on the American Classic Organ soundfont by Paul C. Stratman created after the Aeolian Skinner large organs that were built based on the idea that one instrument could play almost all organ literature effectively.\n\nSince the American Classic Organ soundfont is designed to be used with JOrgan it has few combinations. On the other hand the VirtuOrgan soundfont is designed to be used with any midi software.\n\nTo achieve this I re-organized the presets, added several combinations and raised the\nvolume of Plenum combinations and pedals, giving the final work a total of 200 presets.\n\nThis soundfont has many samples that sound bright and clear so that the result is a high quality and\nrealistic organ music.\n\nA sonata written for this specific soundfont may be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7zKPHiclrvk\n",

    "description": "I decided to call this preset \"Journey\" because I was fooling around trying to get a guitar tone like in the Journey song \"I'll be alright without you\", just like my client requested. Typical bluesy 80's Fender sound.\n\nThen as it turns out, with a bit of Convolver and Delay the tone sounds quite like a \"mystical\" trip to me. So the name \"Journey\" still works in that situation :)\n\nThis demo was played on my Epiphone Explorer with humbucker on the neck pickup.\n\nGenerated with Guitarix:gx_head 0.32.1\n",

    "description": "A huge collection of 128 instruments and 8 drumkits created by Ian Wilson. \nThe instrument sounds include emulations of Yamaha DX-7 and TX81Z, Roland D-50 \nand Casio VL-1 as well as a lot of other analog / vintage / synthetic sounds. \nThe drumkits emulated are Roland TR808, TR909 and CR-78, dnaloR TR-101 (Imaginary \nRoland :-) ), Analog (Lots of Depeche, Yazoo stuff here), Electronic (Small \ncheesy kit) and Kraftwerk (Small set of blippy drums).\n\nIan Wilson spent about a year creating this soundfont, without using samples \ntaken from synthesizers. Instead, the sounds are designed around simple waveforms \nlike Sine, Sawtooth ... etc. The soundfont is thus very small, but surprisingly \nversatile since it contains a full complement of 128 instruments (no variations), \nas well as 8 drum kits. DEFINITELY RECOMMENDED!\n\nThere are more of Ians soundfonts, as well as articles on creating sound, at \nIans website, Vintage Synth Dreams.\n",

It has been used by Phil Collins, \nThompson Twins, Stevie Wonder and The Art of Noise.

I tried to include just about everything I could discern as being different because that got hard to tell after awhile but I think I just got about everything.\n\nI got just about as many sfx as I do instruments so there is a lot of fun and creativity to be had with this soundfont.\n\n(on a side note, percussion is on around middle c.)\n\nI hope you guys enjoy this as I know I most definitely will!\n\nok bai!\n\n-Brian\n",

    "description": "Jacques Prestreau (aka BlackWinny) has taken the time to gather all the freely available 6-OP FM patches on the web and consolidate them into one amazing patch collection.\n\nThese should work in the amazing free FM synth Dexed, and several other 6-OP FM synths.\n\nMore info from Jacques about the collection (available in the read me file):\n\nDexed_cart version 1.0 by BlackWinny, 2015/01/04 (YYYY/MM/DD)\n\nAll these sysex files are (or should be) compatible with Dexed, FM8, and any emulation (software or hardware) of a synth of the 6-OP family of the Yamaha stuff which was produced featuring the FM synthesis with 6 operators.\n\nThis family included:\n\n\nDX7\nDX1\nTX816\nTX216\nTX7\nDX5\nDX7IID\nDX7IIFD\nDX7S\nTX802\n\n\nYou can get many informations about the features of these synths (and their respective differences) here: http://www.synthark.org/Yamaha/6op-FM_Family.html\n\nThere is already a crowd of compilations of sysex files for the Yamaha DX7 and its famous family. But all the compilations I have found are absolutely insane... due to an incredible amount of duplicate files that they contain.\n\nThere is even a compilation which gathers not less than 200,000 patches in 5,917 sysex files! But when comes the time to clean that huge collection... it appears that finally it contains less than 2,000 really different sysex files. Close to four thousands of the files in that 200K collection are in fact duplicate sysex files in many sub-collections... and many of them are even present because of conversions with different applications so with slight different results in the headers or the footers or their checksums. Many of them are even unusable because with errors or absent checksums or bad CRC, etc.\n\nThe same for the Dave Benson's collection, for the Bobby Blues \"All the web\" collection, for the AcidBoxBlues collection, for the Synthzone collection, etc. Each one contains already tons and tons and tons of dupes files, yes. Not only dupes of patches... but tons of dupes of sysex themselves!\n\nHere you will find no dupes of sysex themselves. I have hunted them with the strongest severity.\n\nTo make my own collection, that you have under your eyes, I have took: - That Dx7_200k_collection above (http://korgpatches.com/patches/kronos/dx7_200k_collection)\n\n\nThe Bobby Blues website (one of the most interesting ever)\nThe Acidboxblues website\nThe Dave Benson's DX7 Page\nThe synthzone website\nThe Chris's Music Site\nThe DX7.nl website\nThe Atari page from Tim Conrardy\nThe Aminet website (the true one)\nAnd several smaller websites here and there, all providing sysex files as freewares\n\n\nAll that became a merry jumble (a total of 8,736 sysex files of all sizes and with several extension names!) where I had to find what was with what, who made what, who transformed what, who copied what to create a collection without mentioning the original authors, what was a correct new version of what, what was a failed new version of what, what works and what doesn't work, what is well named and what is badly named, what is a complete collection and what is an incomplete collection, where are the missing files if I had them by chance elsewhere... a titanesque task! It began in August 2014. A first preliminary version came out in September. And at last this first real version 1.0 come out now... in January 2015!\n\nThis new collection (eh eh... yes, it makes of course a new one!) has at least the advantage to be almost entirely sorted. Each time it was possible, I sorted by author. It means that the previous collections (almost all were only compilations of files which are already elsewhere) have been totally split up... and even smashed! Because it was in my opinion very important to sort first by author: the best way to retrieve the uniqueness. And also because a patch is a work of art, and it is respectful to give back to Caesar what belongs to Caesar, and to give back to the artist designer what belongs to this artist designer. But even that it doesn't totally prevent the presence of dupe patches, because a designer can use the same patch in several sysex creations... and also because there are wonderful sysex files made to gather patches for an instrument or made to gather superb patches for a style or music, for example. But each time it was possible I kept in priority the sysex file made by the creator himself... and removed tons and tons of dupes, successive and wrong conversions by different tools, etc.\n\nSome sysex files remain sorted by instruments instead of by authors. They are in the folder \"!Instruments\" which begins by an exclamation point to remain at the top of the list of folders. These sysex files are at this place when the author remains unknown... or when the full sysex file contains all its patches for a specific instrument or type of instrument or for a style or music. But as soon as I could know the author, the file went to his personal folder. But several authors created even some real collections of several sysex files for an instrument, the ensemble constituting itself a collection specific to that instrument. So of course these full collections are classed as well... for the sense of practicality.\n\nI have not split any sysex file... It would have been a work for several years, able to ruin a health or to lead someone to a divorce or to a psychiatric hospital. And it would have been also a risk to destroy by lack of knowledge some files which were in fact the original files by a creator. Eh... when you find ten times a same patch in ten sysex files it is not always possible to know which one is the original one if you don't have a text file explaining that it is the original. Unfortunately the DX7 (and its family) did not give the ability to sign a patch in its structure when exporting it in a sysex.\n\nSome collections remain incomplete. I will try to complete them later, at the fortune of my discovers on the web... or with your help.\n\nAnd to end this text, I mention that there is also a folder named \"!Unsorted\". Everybody will easily understand what it contains: the files that I have not yet got the time to sort... or which resist to my searches. It is probable that this folder contains some duplicate files (by a small difference or because they are new or old versions) related to some files already sorted. If I find what to do with them, they will be put at the right place... or removed like the thousands of duplicate sysex which have already been removed.\n\nIf you find clues to help me about some of these unsorted files (or if you find sorted files wrongly placed or which are duplicates that I have not detected)... feel free to tell me. This collection is yours as well as mine and I shall be happy to make successive new versions to enhance and improve that work. And of course there will be a changelog.\n\nTo use this file in Dexed, don't unzip it! The zip file is named \"Dexed_cart_1.0.zip\". You have just to rename it \"Dexed_cart.zip\" (you have just to remove \"_1.0\").\n\nTo use this file in FM8 (or any other synth having the feature to import DX7 sysex), unzip it and import the result in your synth. That's all.\n\nToday is 2015/01/04 (YYYY/MM/DD) and this version of the file Dexed_Cart.zip is the 1.0.\n\nJacques PRESTREAU (aka BlackWinny), Paris, France\n",

    "description": "I'm not gonna go into detail about which banks are what, most are self-explanatory.\nThough here are a few notes from the soundfont you should know before playing with it:\n\nIf you need help or get stuck in this bank, the .mid's provided within (which are mostly all made by ME btw :)) give perfect examples as to which instruments do what.\n\nAlso remember, that you are working with a SOUNDFONT device. The Bank Select method should be \"Controller 0\".\n\nNotes:\n\n\nMost GM standard sounds have some vibrato/release effects on them. If you want them dry and fully configurable, they're available on Bank 1\nPercussion instruments Patch #'s 113 and up have no release. If you want release, use them on Bank 1 (Except for patch #124)\nAll instruments (including the Drum Kit's Crash Cymbals) except the Bass and Percussion have reverbs set.\nMost envelopes and vibratos play by the FF4 on SNES rules.\n\n\nSome Tips:\n\n\nFinal Fantasy 4 never used more than 2 notes per song when using the Timpani for some reason (The 2 notes differ per song, though)\nThe SNES usually always cut the note about 1 frame before the next note played, whether this is the music system doing it, or the sound chip, it's there. Just a little note for making \"FF4-like\" songs.\n\n\nAdded Notes:\n\n\nPatch #80, 81 and 124 are sound effect sounds: Square Wave, A type of Sawtooth Wave, and SNES generated Noise\nPatch #80 and #81 (Square Lead and a type of Sawtooth Lead) will turn into single, non-phasing tones if you use them on Bank 1 (Ideal for most SFX creation)\n\n\nThat's it. :)\n\nEnjoy! :D\n\n-Mathew Valente [TSSF]\nJuly 18, 2002\n\n\n\nIf you like the work of the author visit his website!\n",

    "description": "Final Fantasy 5 AWE Sound Font\n\nBy: Mathew Valente [TSSF]\n\n\nRequirements\nWarning\nHow to Install\nKnown Problems\nInstrument Map\nEnd Notes\n\n\nBefore I get started, I should mention that this is a one time version, and\nthat I don't plan on fixing / doing anything else to this font.  If you have\nproblems, you might want to ask someone who knows something about sound fonts\nand ask them to fix it, because I'm telling you now, I'm not going to. (I'm\nbusy enough as it is)\n\nI've also included some demonstration songs on how this thing can be programmed\nfor.  If you have any questions or concerns about how to, or where a particular\nFF5 instrument is, please look at the Instrument Map section.\n\nYou might want to also take note that i kept all the original General Midi\nAWE64 instruments in for all the instruments that weren't in FF5.  This is\nhow i keep things compatible.  If people have made a song differently so that\nit doesn't utilize this sound font, don't blame me.\n\nRequirements\n\n\na Soundblaster AWE sound card. (preferably an AWE64, because that's what it\nwas made on)\n512k RAM\n\n\nWarning\n\nI take no blame for anything this sound font does to your AWE, computer\nlives, etc etc etc.  If this sound font blows up your computer, you have no one\nto blame but yourself for using it.  I've tried it on mine, I've had other\npeople try it, it worked fine.  If anything should go wrong, it's not my fault.\nI just wanted to get that straight here and now.\n\nHow to Install\n\nIn Windows, there should be a folder named \"AWE \\u0026lt;whatever\\u0026gt;\" or something.  I\ndon't know how different it is for windows 3.1 users, but here's how to install\nit on Win95.\n\nClick \"[# Start]\", go to \"Programs\", then to \"AWE \\u0026lt;whatever\\u0026gt;\", then go to\n\"AWE Control\".\n\nUnder AWE Control, to load this sound font PROPERLY, you go to \"SYNTH\", run\nbrowse, and select the sound font.  Hit apply and VOILA, you're done.\n\nAgain, this sound font was made for people using at least 512k RAM.  If you\ndon't have it, you most likely will come up with an \"Insufficient Card RAM\"\nerror message.  At this point, the only possible thing you can do is go out\nand order some AWE ram.\n\nKnown Problems\n\nThere are some known problems on some volume envelopes (IE: the Marimba) and\non some sample fine tuning. I tuned them as well as I could, but I'm a busy\nperson and I really can't do this sound font to perfection.\n\nInstrument Map\n\nI'm only going to display the changed instrument names and which program number\nthey are.  (Or NOTE when I'm talking about the drums)\n\nInstrument Program       Before           After\n----------------------------------------------------------\n#000 Piano               c-3 piano        [FF5] Bass Piano\n#010 Music Box           musicbox         [FF5] Music Box\n#011 Vibraphone          vibraphone       [FF5] Vibes\n#012 Marimba             marimba          [FF5] Marimba\n#013 Xylophone           xylophone        [FF5] Marimba\n#015 Dulcimer            dulcimer         [FF5] Dulcimer\n#017 Jazz Organ          jazzorg          [FF5] Percussive Organ\n#018 Rock Organ          rockorg          [FF5] Percussive Organ\n#024 NylonString Guitar  nylonst          [FF5] Jazz Guitar\n#026 Jazz Guitar         jazzgtr          [FF5] Guitar\n#030 Distortion Guitar   distgtr          [FF5] Distortion Guitar\n#033 Finger Bass         fbass            [FF5] Finger Bass\n#034 Pick Bass           pbass            [FF5] Pick Bass\n#036 Slap Bass           slapbass1        [FF5] Pick Bass\n#046 Harp                pickharp         [FF5] Harp\n#047 Timpani             timpani          [FF5] Timpani\n#048 Strings             string           [FF5] Strings\n#049 Slow Strings        string           [FF5] Strings\n#052 Choir Ahh           femalev          [FF5] Choir Ooh\n#056 Trumpet             trumpet          [FF5] Trumpet\n#060 French Horn         fhorn1           [FF5] French Horn\n#068 Oboe                oboe             [FF5] Oboe\n#073 Flute               flute            [FF5] Flute\n#085 Solo Vox            angchoir/svox    [FF5] \\u0026amp;lt; C-5 Dawn Chord\n                                                C-5 \\u0026amp;gt; Bass Chord\n#114 Steel Drums         stldrums         [FF5] Steel Drums\n#117 Toms                syntom           [FF5] Toms\n\n-- Drums (Channel 10)\n\nC#2                                       [FF5] Low Huh!\nD-2                                       [FF5] Huh!\nB-2  Heavy Bass Drum     bdrum            [FF5] Bass Drum\nC-3  Bass Drum           bdrum            [FF5] Bass Drum\nD-3  Snare               snare            [FF5] Snare\nD#3  Claps               applause         [FF5] Claps\nE-3  Heavy Snare         snare            [FF5] Heavy Snare\nF-3  Low Low Tom         floortom         [FF5] Toms\nF#3  Hihat Closed        hihatop          [FF5] Hihat Closed\nG-3  Low Medium Tom      floortom         [FF5] Toms\nA-3  Low High Tom        floortom         [FF5] Toms\nA#3  Hihat Opened        hihatop          [FF5] Hihat Opened\nB-3  Medium Low Tom      floortom         [FF5] Toms\nC-4  Medium Medium Tom   floortom         [FF5] Toms\nC#4  Crash Cymbal        crash            [FF5] Crash Cymbal\nD-4  Medium High Tom     floortom         [FF5] Toms\nD-6  Full Guiro          guiro            [FF5] Guiro\n\n\nEnd Notes\n\nI might have missed a couple notes in the drums.. try playing around and see\nwhat you come up with.

    "description": "Hi! Have you ever wanted to write your own music with the sounds of Mother 3? Well today's your lucky-- What? Say that again? You don't even know how this file ended up on your computer? Oh. That's... kinda scary. It's like a high-tech ghost story. Hm.\n\n...\n\nWell, wanna have a go at it anyway?\n\n\n\nOh! Before I forget, I wrote an album of 12 original songs, using only this soundfont. The album's called Clay Memory. Take a listen to hear this soundfont in action: https://fluidvolt.bandcamp.com\n\nWhat is this thing?\n\nAfter Bregalad created his fantastic program GBA Mus Riper, it's been possible to dump Mother 3's sounds into a massive soundfont of 1668(!) instruments. For the purposes of playing Mother 3 midis it's perfect. Trying to write your own music with it though... not so much. I'm not saying it can't be done, but it's gonna be a struggle. There's not a name to be found and it has tons of near-duplicate instruments.\n\nThat's where this soundfont comes in handy. I combed through the gigantic raw soundfont of 1668 instruments, weeded out duplicate instruments, removed junk data, etc. Fast-forward more hours than I care to count, and, after naming and organizing, it's been pared down to a more manageable 214 instruments. Still a lot, but it's a \"rubbing your hands together, can't wait to get started\" a lot, not a \"tearing your hair out, this is freakin' impossible\" a lot.\n\nHow to use\n\nIf your music software supports soundfonts natively, just pop the .sf2 files into its soundfont/resource folder and get composing! If not, there are plenty of free VSTi plug-ins that will allow you to use soundfonts. Do a quick web search for one and you'll be set.\n\nAs for how the soundfont is organized, it's pretty straightforward. The main soundfont is split up between the melodic patches (patches no. 00 - 128) and percussive (depending on your soundfont player, percussion may start on patch no. 129, or it might be in its own bank, no. 128). The percussive set is also a catch-all collection full of weird pad sounds, drum loops, sound effects, and basic Gameboy sounds.\n\nThere's also an additional soundfont of 100 instruments where I split the drumkit into individual instruments. This is useful if you want to pitch the drumkit sounds independently or for more fine-tuned control.\n\nAlso, keep in mind many of the instrument names are suggestions, at best. Be creative with the sounds!\n\nLegal Stuff\n\nIt goes without saying, but just in case it doesn't: all sounds in this soundfont belong to HAL Laboratory, Inc.\n\nThanks\n\nThanks to Bregalad. Without GBA Mus Riper this wouldn't exist.\n\nThanks to sleepytimejesse, who started me out on this whole soundfont-makin' thing.\n\nThanks to the fine folks at Ubiktune, both for hosting these files and the companion album. Check 'em out for some great music.\n\nThanks to Clyde \"Mato\" Mandelin and the Mother 3 translation team. I'm sincerely grateful for the opportunity to play Mother 3 in English.\n\nAnd, of course, extra-special thanks to Shigesato Itoi for making wonderful, deeply beautiful games, and to Keiichi Suzuki, Hirokazu Tanaka and Shogo Sakai for making wonderful, deeply beautiful music to match.\n",

    "description": "The Glover 64 soundfont is huge. There are almost 200 patches here if you include the drums (and why wouldn't you?). The Glover soundtrack is one of my favorites, the drum loops combined with the often-bizarre melodies make it sound like hip hop from another dimension. And the soundfont is extremely versatile, there are tons of melodic instruments, drum hits, and sixteen unique drum loops. I love this soundfont.\n\nLet me explain the organization scheme a bit. Instruments 1 - 46 I found in the main instrument bank. 47 - 73 are sounds strewn throughout the ROM that sounded melodic enough, including some sound effects. 74 and 75 are edits I made to try and remove some clicking in the original samples. In the percussion bank, 1 - 36 I found in what seems to be the main percussion set, while 37 - 74 are miscellaneous hits and SFX. 75 - 90 are drum loops (one of the highlights of the font, for sure), and 91-120 are instruments I manually created by cutting out samples from the drum loops.\n\nIn other words, I love the sounds in Glover so much that I omitted almost nothing, and in some cases even created sub-sounds. What'd I tell you? I love this soundfont.\n\n\n\nIf you like the work of the author visit the site and listen to the music in Soundcloud, Bandcamp or Youtube!\n",

    "description": "I think it's the smallest soundfont I've ripped: only twelve instruments and almost half are percussion. The loop points might sound a bit wonky but that's actually how they sound in-game, if you can look past that though it really is a solid little sound bank. The percussion sounds great and it has a nice booming timpani.\n\n\n\nIf you like the work of the author visit the site and listen to the music in Soundcloud, Bandcamp or Youtube!\n",

I cleaned it up, used some nicer plug-ins and remixed the tune a little.\n\nThis session uses the following plug-ins:\n\n\nC* Plate Reverb\nCalf Compressor\nCalf Vintage Delay\nCalf Reverb\nCalf Phaser: on the lead guitar\nGuitarix (ladspa): For overdrive guitar and lead guitar\nGxAmplifier (lv2) and GxRedEye Big Chump: for the clean guitar sounds\nZynAddSubFx (lv2): for keys and lead synthesizer sounds\n\n\nThe zipped file also includes dance_test.xmz, which is the Zyn set-up for this track which can be loaded in the plugin or standalone version, and ladspa.gx the Guitarix bank file with the overdrive and lead sounds (if you want to use the sounds place this file in ~/.config/guitarix/banks).\n\nThis session also uses some 120bpm loops from the Total Harmonic Distortion pack by Stretta.\n",

    "description": "A guitarix preset for the song Deadhead by the canadian metal master Devin Townsend. It's very noisy and you should tweak the reverb and the delay to suit your needs.\n\nThe original recording has lots of layers of guitars and reverb so this is not really a reproduction of that tone, just something you can use for fun and to build upon. Also my guitar and strings dont really suit this riff, but I've recorded the demo sounds anyway.  It's also pretty good for lead sounds!\n\nIncluded are two presets, 'Deadhead' and 'Deadhead Dry' which is just the original preset but without the heavy reverb and delay.\n\nHave fun and remember: always pick down for extra heavyness ;)\n",

    "description": "This is a Japanese Fender Jaguar recorded on the both pickups setting direct in and also through a valve driven Fender reverb unit. This can be used with software amplifiers such as the free fender and marshall vst plugins on this forum (there are lots of software guitar amplifier and pedal related things worth downloading on the Guitar Amp Modelling forum) or amplifier impulse response files with your convolution reverbs like Jconv on Linux or Freeverb on Windows.\n\nThis giga sample also has presets that are through a Fender reverb unit. The reverb unit is designed to go before the amplifier so it is well suited to a direct in recording that is later going to be processed (i.e. put through a software amplifier). You also have a choice of how much reverb you use just by using the mod wheel 2 (cc13) on certain presets. Mod wheel 1 (cc1) is the release. This is so that you can easily set the length of the notes as long as you need.\n\nOther presets include a fake twelve string (octave harmonies on each key), low pass filtered, split voices of muted fifths at one end and solo guitar at the other end of the keyboard (for quickly creating tunes and ideas) and all sorts of different combinations of presets to cover most options. The only two controllers you need for any of the presets are mod wheel 1 (cc1) and mod wheel 2 (cc13). The functions of these controllers are always part of the preset name.\n",

    "description": "This is a solid body bass guitar that has a full deep sound. There is not much middle to it which makes it less defined than a lot of basses but it does suit some music very well. There is a choice of sample sets to choose from in this gigasample. Direct or through my j-station (which makes it sound more like its through an amp), or a mix somewhere between the two.\n\nThe j-station samples are the same direct samples routed out and through the j-station and back in again, which is why it is possible to have a mix of the two. The J-Station samples make a distorted beefy bass sound which can be useful for some music i.e. 3 piece bands where tha bass fills out instead of a rhythm guitar or just for a more lo-fi bass sound. The direct samples are not so distorted and can be used in alot more styles of music. You can use a mix of the direct and J-Station samples to get the balance of dirt just right on one of the presets (using mod wheel 2 or cc13).\n\nThere is a preset that includes slaps and slides etc to help add some realism.\n",

    "description": "The single keys at the beginning of the keyboard (C2-C3 white notes only) contain a variety of percussion instruments (2 wood blocks, an Irish bongo, a mini rain stick, a mini swinging drum, a tambourine, a mini hollow wood log and a mini wooden scraper). Then the black keys further up are groups of instruments that cut each other off. For instance the first group of black notes (F#3,G#3,A#3) are all samples from the big conga but with different hit types. The next 2 black notes are a dear skin bongo. The next 3 black notes are the little conga. The next 2 black notes are a little metal bongo. The next 3 black notes are the medium conga and the next 2 black notes are a home made plastic shaker. This makes it easy to know the grouped instruments. It is also easy to whack a way at the congas (like real congas) as they are all the black keys in groups of 3 and each conga cuts its own keys off if another is played. I mainly recorded this for the 3 congas and then added the other bits as I had them laying around (some are even from my childrens musical instruments bag, i.e. wood blocks from the early learning centre and a home made plastic shaker). The congas are boomy when played hard but with a lot more delicate hand sound when played softly. It is possible to get a variety of sounds and styles with these conga samples.\n",

    "description": "This is a Japanese Fender Jaguar electric guitar played on the both pick-ups setting and is played through a Fender Bassman '59 Reissue with old valves in. This amp gives a really nice full clean sound. I have recorded it on the edge of break up so the low velocity samples come out clean and the high velocity samples come out with a bit of nataural power valve distortion. You can add more distortion with effects if you need it dirtier. It is hard to get this natural break up sound with effects which is why I have recorded it that way and if you add distortion it still has the natural bite of a valve amp (except with more distortion). This makes it very expressive just by the difference in tones at different played velocities. The lowest velocity is muted samples. Presets include split keyboard of muted 5ths at one end and solo guitar at the other end (good for jamming out tunes), muted samples preset, a fake 12-string (octave harmonies on each key), slaps and slides etc and a standard mapping. The sound is suited to a lot of types of music. These guitars have been used for all sorts of music over the years. It has not much sustain and makes a bright clean sound.\n",

    "description": "An acoustic guitar suited to bluesy rhythms. Has quite alot of fret rattle with the high velocities but also a certain amount of mid to high frequencies which helps to give it its own place in a mix. You also have a choice of how much reverb you use just by using the mod wheel 2 (cc13) on certain presets. The reverb is a genuine old Fender Reverb unit. Which is a valve driven spring reverb. Not only is it a nice classic reverb but just putting the samples through it warms them up straight away. Mod wheel 1 (cc1) is the release. This is so that you can easily set the length of the notes as long as you need. Other presets include a fake twelve string (octave harmonies on each key), low pass filtered (for a more nylon guitar sound), split voices of muted fifths at one end and solo guitar at the other end of the keyboard (for quickly creating tunes and ideas) and alsorts of different combinations of presets to cover most options.

Two primary sets of samples are provided - arco (that's bowed) and pizz (plucked) - with the addition of various \"noises\". If you check out his performance video, on YouTube, you might see what these might be used for... also the start of the demos below.\n\nArco is 5 velocity layers with 2 round robins, pizz is 3 velocity layers with 3-4 round robins and noises have no velocity layers and sometimes have round robins. \n",

The recording path was from the Moog to an Event Darla and captured in Sound Forge.\n\nBit Rate: 16-bit ; Sample Rate: 44,100 Hz ; Channels: Mono\n\nThe Gigasampler set breaks each octave (C1 to C7) into different drum groups. Commonly Kick drums are on C, Snares on D, Hi-hats on C# and D#, Toms on F, G and A, ect. Just use it, you'll get the picture.\n",

The samples have been converted from mp3 to wave, and regularly disposed in space from left to right, using the pan adjustment in the soundfont with Vienna Soundfont.\n\nIn this belfry, there are no bells for the B and the C sharp of the first octave. To respect the original instrument, i did not add these missing notes. If you want them, and if you know how to make soundfont, you can interpolate them easily. The whole soundfont weighs 26,2 MB. If you want the Hauprtwerk version, please go to Soni Musicae / Hauptwerk.\n",

    "description": "Here is a sound bank of a small diatonic accordion, with 21 keys on two rows at the right hand, and 8 basses at the left, and a second stop that sounds lower. A diatonic accordion does not produce the same notes when you push or pull the bellows, and this makes this instrument not so easy to play... More, it has not all the semi-tones of its 3 octaves (from D2 to E5). With this sound bank, you can forget those drawbacks, because we have \"interpolated\" the missing notes, and all the notes are played in a same manner on a keyboard...\nThis sound bank is available here in soundfont and kontakt2 formats.\n\nIn order to use a sound bank of a diatonic accordion correctly, you must know that the left keys are used to play accompaniment, and allow to alternate basses and chords, as you can hear it in a waltz. This instrument has 6 basses (C, D, E, F, G, A) and 6 chords (C major, D major, E major, F major, G major and A minor). In order to play them easily at the same time than the melody, we put them on the two first octaves of a piano, C-A0 for basses, and C-A1 for chords. So you can alternate basses and chords balancing fingers from an octave to the other. It requires a big keyboard with 88 keys, like a piano, or two smaller keyboards with at least 55 keys... To make it easier to use, left keys and right keys of this accordion are separate in different presets.\n\nYou must also know that, on the real instrument, the left keys can be played with the first or the second stop simultaneaously, but it is impossible to play the two stops together. It would be useless, anyway, because the reeds used by the second stop are the same as the ones used by the first. The second stop adds a lower sounding reed to the first stop. Please consider this if you want to use this sound bank in a realistic way.\n",

    "description": "We are pleased to present you the bank of a small house organ, 250 pipes, 5 real stops on two manuals (plus a coupled keyboard), built in 1988. It comes in soundfont and Kontakt 2 versions. If you are a user of Hauptwerk format, go to Soni Musicae / Hauptwerk. \n\nAt first, we did not want to distribute it, because this is not an extraordinary organ, and it was impossible to avoid a big noise of organ-blower during the recording : as it is a house organ, it stood in a flat, and the microphones could not stand far from it. But, finally, after some numerical treatments, we think that the result is not so bad, and we give it to you as close as possible to the real thing, without changing many of its defaults...\n\nThere is no natural reverb in the rather small room where it stood, and the sound is dry and a bit agressive, specially in the high notes, because it is the sound of the original instrument, and it is also the result of the numerical treatments that remove the noise of the organ-blower.\n\nThe organ is tuned to A 440 Hz and to equal temperament.\n\nTo make this organ easy to use, this sf2 soundbank comes with many presets that respect the usual relevant combinations of the original instrument. You will find :\n\n01 - bourdon 8'\n02 - flute 4'\n03 - octave 2'\n04 - chimney flute 8'\n05 - flute 2'\n06 - bourdon 8' + flute 4'\n07 - bourdon 8' + flute 4' + octave 2'\n08 - bourdon 8' + chimney flute 8'\n09 - chimney flute 8' + flute 4'\n10 - chimney flute 8' + flute 4' + octave 2'\n11 - chimney flute 8' + octave 2'\n12 - chimney flute 8' + flute 2'\n13 - chimney flute 8' + flute 4' + flute 2'\n14 - bourdon 8' + flute 4' + flute 2'\n15 - bourdon 8' + chimney flute 8' + flute 4'\n16 - bourdon 8' + chimney flute 8' + flute 4' + Flute 2'\n17 - bourdon 8' + chimney flute 8' + octave 2'\n18 - bourdon 8' + chimney flute 8' + flute 4' + octave 2'\n19 - bourdon 8' + flute 2'\n20 - bourdon 8' + octave 2'\n21 - flute 4' + flute 2'\n22 - Tutti\n\n\nIn the Kontakt 2 version, there are not all those combinations, because you can do your own as you like...\n",

    "description": "Using this soundbank in a sampler, you can play a virtual harpsichord copied after a 18th century french instrument by Blanchet. It has one manual, two 8' stops, plus a lute stop. This soundbank is available in soundfont, and Kontakt 2 format. If you want a version for Hauptwerk, go to Soni Musicae / Hauptwerk. The soundfont version is not complete, because it has not the sound of mechanics (that are in original samples) when the musician releases the keys of the harpsichord, but the one for Kontakt has it.\n\nThe keyboard of a harpsichord is not touch sensitive (dynamic), and sounds at the same level whatever you press the keys, but it seems that it is impossible to obtain this with the soundfont format... To avoid dynamic differences and respect the original instrument, you can adjust velocity in your sequencer in a way that the volume is constantly the highest... The Kontakt 2 version does not need this. \n",

Here I have\nUbuntu studio with Jack, Guitarix, Ardour, all the fine stuff.\nAnd I'm using desktop speakers and a headphone.\n\nThe patches attached are very basic - not many effects, most of them just with a little ambient, so I can use\nthem as a starting point for other stuff. (I'm not happy with the clean ones at all, so please ignore them)\nThey are also not very different from each other, just different flavours or different drive.\n",

Licence\n\n\n\nThe Mellotron samples in this Giga file were made by taijiguy, a.k.a. Bernie Kornowicz, and are his copyright. You are free to use the samples in any way you like, except to package them for commercial purposes. This licence gives you the right to use these samples, together or separately, in any creative musical work whatever, free or commercial. These musical works may be distributed in any way, without any attribution whatever. You MAY NOT sell the samples or the Giga file and you may not repackage the samples in a different format and sell that.\n\nThis Giga file are made by Quirq with Bernie's express permission and is copyright Quirq. You may freely distribute this Giga file, provided that it is distributed with this README file and provided that it is not distributed commercially.\n\n2. Giga format\n\n\n\nWith the permission of Bernie, the samples were compiled into Giga format by Quirq in December 2010, using Gigedit, part of the LinuxSampler project (www.linuxsampler.org). Bernie had one note per sample, so no pitchshifting was necessary and the natural range of a Mellotron has been retained.\n\nTo retain the essence of the Mellotron, the samples are unlooped and not velocity sensitive in any way. A low pass filter is mapped to the modwheel to emulate the tone control on a real Mellotron. No other unnatural effects or tweaking are used, except as mentioned below for the \"M400\" sounds.\n\nThe large Giga file is keyswitched so that you can change sounds in real time -- as you could on a real Mellotron -- that is, without having to load another Giga file. The keyswitching runs from C0 to C1 (a fifth below the bottom note on a Tron). The switching works as follows:\n\nC0  M400 Violins\nC#0 M400 Violins Yes EQ\nD0  M400 Violins Smooth Ryder EQ\nD#0 Cello\nE0  String Section\nF0  Mk II Violins\nF#0 M300A (violins)\nG0  M300B (solo violin)\nG#0 Mk II Brass\nA0  GC3 Brass\nA#0 Mk II Flute\nB0  Woodwind2\nC1  Combined Choir\n\n\n3. About the samples\n\n\n\nThe samples contained in this Giga file were recorded by Bernie Kornowicz, a.k.a. taijiguy on the KVR Audio forums, and can be found on his website http://leisureland.us/audio/MellotronSamples/MellotronSamples.htm.\n\nFrom the site:\n\"The 3 Violins and Combined Brass were sampled in 2003 from a 1973 Mellotron M400S. The String Section, Combined Choir, GC3 Brass, M300A, M300B and Woodwind 2 were sampled in 2008. The Mk II Flute and Cello were sampled in 2010... The samples were recorded \"hot\" with the tone control fully clockwise. This is not how M400's are normally played. The tone control is generally set from about 1/8 to 1/3 clockwise, assuming the amplification system tones are flat.\n\n\"These samples have not been looped so as to retain the need to use the spider technique of playing a real Mellotron. If you want to loop them, that's your choice. They are approximately 7 seconds in length and retain both the initial attack, and in many cases, the bad endings.\"\n\nThe Mk II Violins and Mk II Brass samples are also hosted by Real Media Music at http://realmusicmedia.net/Mellotron.html.\n\nThe information on that site states that the Tron is a M400S, serial number 500, whose restoration was completed on 28th August 2005. At the time the Three Violins and Combined Brass were sampled \"The Tron's condition was decent. The heads were cleaned and the azimuth was aligned by Streetly Electronics in England (the original maker of the Tron) just prior to sampling. The capstan was clean, but the pinch rollers were a little dry. The cabinet was out of square. The tapes and frame were brand new.\"\n\n4. The equalised Mk II Strings\n\n\n\nConventional wisdom has it that the famous Three Violins sound from the M400 Mellotron was just the previous Mk II Violins sound that had been highpass filtered. Ryder Duncan, a.k.a. Squonk on YouTube, does not think that this is the case and, after extensive experimentation, has arrived at EQ settings which he feels come much closer to turning the Mk II Violins into the M400 Three Violins/Violins sound. Details can be found at http://ryderduncan.com/themusicalbox/?p=33. \n\nSquonk's videos on YouTube are also well worth checking out if you are a Tron fanatic.\n\nThe Mk II Violins samples were processed using these EQ settings to create the three pseudo-M400 sounds: \"M400 Violins\" for the generic EQ settings, \"M400 Violins Yes EQ\" for a softer, more Yes-like sound and \"M400 Violins Smooth Ryder EQ\" is Ryder Duncan's own personal EQ settings for a smooth sound.\n\n5. About the Mellotron sounds\n\n\n\nPlease see the section above regarding the M400 Violins sound and its relationship to the original Mk II Violins. The M400 was the most portable and cheapest incarnation of the Mellotron and was introduced in 1970. After this time, I would expect most, if not all, bands touring with Mellotrons would have used the M400. No doubt many studios still retained Mk IIs, but the smoother, softer, more luscious M400 Violins sound is what one usually associates with music made after this time, such as by the likes of The Strawbs, Genesis, Yes, Red-era King Crimson and countless other great progressive rock bands of the 1970s and beyond. The M400's predecessor, the rare M300, had all new soundsets recorded for it, in two banks labelled A and B. These sounds were apparently favoured by the late \"Woolly\" Wolstenholme of Barclay James Harvest: the M300 was popular with BJH, Gentle Giant and others. The Mk II was a huge, two manual beast released in 1964, so music such as \"Nights In White Satin\" and other classics by the The Moody Blues and early King Crimson would have featured the much more strident, almost grating sound of the Mk II Violins (which is what the modwheel/\"tone control\" is there for!). The Mk II and M400 Violins are three instruments together, hence also being commonly called the Three Violins sound. The M300A strings sound was two violins playing together, whereas the M300B sound is a solo violin.\n\nThe 'cello sounds were recorded by a session musician called Reginald Kirby. According to many sources (possibly all repeating each other), Reg played on a number of recordings by The Beatles \"including Eleanor Rigby\", although other sources give a different name for the cellist on that piece. Anyway, Reg refused to re-tune his 'cello for the Mellotron recording session, so the bottom five notes of the Mellotron Cello are actually double bass, which is why they sound so dramatically different.\n\nThe Mk II Brass, or Mk II Combined Brass as it is also known, is a mixture of two saxophones, a trombone and two trumpets. The GC3 Brass was created for a Scottish jazz trombonist called George Chisholm and is three recordings of individual trombone notes mixed together.\n\nThe Combined Choir is a mixture of the Boys Choir, Male Choir and Female Choir sounds and is not to be confused with the famous 8 Choir, which consists of four male and four female singers.\n\nThe Woodwind2 apparently includes a French horn and a piccolo. In addition to what exactly, I don't know...\n\nv1.0 [03/02/11]\n\nAbout the Demo\n\nThe demo plays through each of the sounds in turn: \"M400 Violins\", \"M400 Violins Yes EQ\", \"M400 Violins Smooth Ryder EQ\", Cello, followed by demonstration of the five double-bass notes on the Cello sound, String Section, Mk II Strings, M300A (violins), M300B (solo violin), Mk II Brass, GC3 Brass, Mk II Flute, Woodwind2, Combined Choir.\n\nThere then follows a demonstration of the low-pass filter, which is swept using the modwheel, using the \"M400 Violins\" sound. Notice the tapes running out: the Mellotron's seven or eight second note length is preserved as the samples are not looped. The filter is manipulated again briefly to find a nice setting, before playing a pad part using the \"M400 Violins\". The final part of the demo uses a short motif played with the filter fully open again, first on the \"M400 Violins\", then String Orchestra, M300A (violins), M300B (solo violin), Mk II Brass, GC3 Brass, Flute, Woodwind2 and finally Combined Choir. No processing of any kind was used, except Linuxsampler's in-built low-pass filter, where noted above.\n",

The purpose of this soundfont is to emulate the YM2612 and PSG chip found in the Sega Genesis (aka Megadrive) without having to learn how to use TFM or the VOPM vst plugin. The project started out as Famicom Disk System-Megadrive Fusion, but as I was able to get more samples via KMOD Gens and TFM, a new soundfont was made using the drum samples from FDS-MD fusion, but this one dropped the FDS samples and focused on Genesis samples.\n\nWhere are the samples from?\n\nAcoustic Piano - Came with TFM\nElectric Piano - From Sonic 1\nHarpsichord - Came with TFM\nClavi/Sitar - Came with TFM\nChimes - Knuckles' Chaotix (32X)\nVibraphone - Sonic 1\nOrgan 1 - Knuckles' Chaotix/Sonic Crackers\nOrgan 2 - Sonic 2\nNylon Guitar/Harp/Jazz Guitar - Came with TFM\nSteel Guitar - Came with TFM\nDistortion Guitar - Came with TFM\nAcoustic/Fretless Bass - Knuckles' Chaotix\nElectric Bass - Sonic 1\nSlap Bass - Sonic 1 Megamix, may be from Sonic 3\nSynth Bass - Sonic 3\nStrings - Sonic 1\nPizz.

    "description": "Squarefont\n\nBy: Steven Rhodes\n(A.K.A. Protoform)\n\nVERSION 3\n\nDISCLAIMER\n\nIf you use this soundfont you agree not to hold the creator responsible for\nany problems caused by this soundfont to your computer or your sound card.\nYou shouldn't have any problems with it. It seems to work fine on my computer\nbut if anything bad happens to your computer don't blame me.\n\nIn other words: USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!!!\n\nREQUIREMENTS\n\n\nA computer.\nSome MIDI files.\nAn Sound Blaster 32 or 64 card with 512k DRAM.\n\n\nPreferably a AWE64 since that's what I used to make this soundfont.\n\nINSTALLATION\n\n\nUnzip the SQUARE.ZIP file into a directory. I Recommend using WINZIP which\ncan be found at www.winzip.com\nClick on the AWE CONTROL option in the START menu. It should be located\nin PROGRAMS and then the Sound Blaster AWE 32 or in the Sound Blaster AWE 64\ndirectory depending on which one you have.\nClick on the SYNTH tab.\nGo to the AVAILABLE SYNTH: option and click on the tab and click on\nUSER SYNTH.\nClick on BROWSE and click on the directory that you unzipped the\nSQUARE.ZIP file and double click on a file called SQUARE.SF2\nIf you can't see it in the directory you could click on the LIST FILES OF\nTYPE: option and click on the ALL FILES option.\nClick on the APPLY button and your set to go.\n\n\nABOUT THIS SOUNDFONT\n\nThe main reason that I constructed this soundfont was because I just got sick\nof listening to normal instruments that came with the sound card. I also\nwanted to make a soundfont for Final Fantasy 7 and thought it would be cool\nif you could use the instruments out of Squaresoft's Super Nintendo games and\nSQUAREFONT was born. The games that I ripped the instruments from were\nFinal Fantasy III, Final Fantasy V, Chrono Trigger and Secret of Mana. This\nsoundfont is also universal for playing just about any midi file based on\nSquaresoft games. You can find a couple at www.rpgamer.com or fly.to/doom\nThe Midi files that are included with this soundfont came out of Final \nFantasy 7 meaning that I take no credit for the making of these midi files.\nThe credit goes to the people that wrote the music for FF7.\n\nINSTRUMENTS REPLACED\n\nHere is the list of instruments that have been replaced.\n\nInstrument Name                Before                                After\n---------------                ------                                -----\n#000 - piano1                  kpianob1                        FF5 - Piano\n#001 - piano2                  kpianob1                        FF5 - Piano\n#002 - piano3                  kpianob1                        FF5 - Piano\n#008 - celesta                 vibese2                         SOM - Vibraphone\n       scelesta                tbelld4wave                     FF3 - Tubular Bell\n#009 - glockenspiel            sinetick                        Removed\n       sglockenspiel           glockloopc4                     CT  - Glockenspiel\n#010 - musicbox                sinetick                        Didn't change\n       smusicbox               octavewave                      FF5 - Music Box\n#011 - vibraphone              vibese2                         SOM - Vibraphone\n#012 - marimba                 marimbac3                       CT  - Marimba \n#014 - tubularbell             tbelld4wave                     FF5 - Tubular Bell\n#015 - dulcimer                dlcmrc3                         FF5 - Santur\n#016 - organ1                  oboeresynwaved4                 CT  - Organ 1\n       sorgan1                 octavewave                      CT  - Organ 1\n#017 - organ2                  organwavea3                     CT  - Organ 2\n#018 - organ3                  organwavea3                     CT  - Organ 2\n       sorgan3                 shakua2                         CT  - Piccolo\n#019 - churchorg1              octavewave                      CT  - Organ 1\n       schurchorgan            flutec4                         SOM - Flute\n#020 - reedorgan               harmonicaa3+octavewave          SOM - Harmonica\n       sreedorgan              oboeresynwave                   SOM - Oboe\n#021 - accordian               accordfx3                       CT  - Accordian\n#022 - harmonica               harmonicaa3                     SOM - Harmonica\\u0026amp;amp;Oboe\n#023 - bandneon                accordfx3                       SOM - Oboe\n       sbandneon               guitar1                         CT  - Square Wave\n#024 - nylonstrgtr             nguitrf2+nguitrb2+acgtrb3       FF3 - Nylon Guitar\n#025 - steelstrgtr             acgtrg2+acgtrb3                 FF3 - Nylon Guitar\n#029 - overdrivegt             distgtra2+distgtre3             CT  - Distortion G\n       soverdrivegt            jazzguitloop                    Removed\n#030 - distortiongt            distgtra2+distgtre3+distgtra3   CT  - Distortion G\n#032 - accousticbs             acbasse1                        CT  - Accoustic Bs\n#033 - fingeredbs              gsbassd2                        CT  - Fingered Bs.\n#034 - pickedbs                bassguitloop+pluckharp          FF5 - Picked Bs.\n                                                               FF5 - Harp\n#035 - fretlessbs              fretlessa2+pluckharp            FF3 - Fretless Bs.\n                                                               FF5 - Harp\n#038 - synthbass1              bsawtoothwavea3                 CT  - Bass \\u0026amp;amp;

Since it is going to\ntake me a while to make a list on what has been updated I might place a list\non my webpage in the future.\n\nUNTIL NEXT TIME...\n\n-STEVEN RHODES 1999\n",

    "description": "Introduction\n\nThis is a synthesized Soundfont, made specifically for Soundfont-based soundcards. Most preferably, the SBLive!\nThe Gameboy waveforms consist of small-wave-use, to make strange-like sounds. In this case, Gameboy-rather.\n\nMy source is included, in case you want to continue it from the version you used last. It's in Audio Compositor format the source, so keep in mind, that if you run AC with it, make sure to map the wave files required, to the sample library. :)\n\nBTW, most samples on the GB soundfont, are 'synthesized' so it sounds more like the real thing, using gameboy sounds. Just remember that it uses pretty much Polyphony. I'll try to use polyphony a lot less in a few later versions. ;)\n\nWhat it contains\n\n\n5 GB wavefrms (Square, Saw, Saw2, Sine and Noise)\nDrumkit. (Temporary maybe?)\nSynthesized patches. (To sound like the real thing, using GBWave. :))\n\n\nRequirements\n\n\n1MB RAM. (it uses like less than 100kb anyway ;))\nSound Blaster AWE64/Live!/Audigy/Extigy or compatible.\n1024 Polyphony set.\nMIDI volume set to 90%\n\n\nWhat's new:\n\nv0.51\n\n\nRevoked the really-messy LFO articulation and CC9x enhancements. (for the moment)\nCleaned up hell alot of samples\n-Added a 'cent' enhancement to replace chorused/phased samples.\n-Added Distorted Gits 2\n-Added the EA2 preset thinger for MIDI-compatible effects\n\n\nv0.50\n\n\nHuge 'difference' release:\nMore sample patches (now consists of 40+ patches)\nVolume Fixes and tweaks.\nArticulation re-maps.\nAdded GB Drums (incomplete)\nAdded noise waveform.\nMany many many more crap that's changed...\n\n\nv0.25a:\n\n\nFixed the octaved instruments' loudness.\n\n\nv0.24:\n\n\nFixed the note-limit problem. (extra wav files with their respective region)\nFixed Piano loudness\nFixed other various problems\nAdded 3 more patches (Overdr Git, Slp bs, Nylon git)\nBASSED the BASS\nIncluded the ACP file in the package (For those who use Audio Compositor, and wants to see the source)\nIncluded the GM list. (Some patches are removed, because i remove the names of what has already been done in the soundfont)\nOther bugs I've fixed...\n\n\nv0.22c:\n\n\nRealised wave enlargement wasn't helping the note limit.. different wav files may be in place in later versions... :(\n\n\nv0.22b:\n\n\nAdded Patch 48 (strings normal, slightly warbled)\n\n\nv0.22a:\n\n\nAdded Patch 1 (Brightened Patch 0)\nAdded Patch 20 (Reeds)\nOctaved patch 21 (Octavocordions aka GB Accordions)\nCurrently working on the note-limit fix.. no improvement as of yet.\n\n\nv0.20:\n\n\nRe-sampled the waves AGAIN. (due to lack of improvement on the 'note limit'\nFixed a few loop ends on the waves\nNow all waves are C4 note base. (they were previously 'recorded' overriden note bases)\nChanged the readme. (It sounded a bit too mean)\nSince the fix, the file size and ram consumption has raised from 1kb to 7kb.\nOther minor tweaks, which i will not list here.. ;)\n\n\nv0.15:\n\n\nFixed a tad flaw with a 'note limit' on the single wave files (still imperfect, will be fixed later)\nRe-sampled the waveforms.\n\n\nWARNING\n\nMaliceX does not take the responsibility to any damage caused by this Beta soundfont.\n\nIt is totally UP TO YOU on HOW to use this thing WISELY. If it damages your 'Boom-Boom Speakers' I will not take any responsibility, since I am not liable to damage your computer myself.\n\nThis project is not copyrighted, so the sources included are yours freely. But I would appreciate some credit for that. :)\n\nI will NOT allow 'selling' or 'compiling' with this soundfont. As is.\n\nAlso, I am not affliated to Nintendo (R) nor any other company/person/etc. \n\nThis is a solo project, but is open-source freely.\n\nBut I MAY accept other improvements to this soundfont, into the 'official' releases. You will receive full credit of course. ;)\n\nLinks/Mirrors\n\nhttp://www.zophar.net (Emulation News and downloads)\n\nhttp://www.geocities.com/myscreenjr (permission to link the file through here granted.)\n\nhttp://sonikstudios.dyndns.org/malicex (My personal directory, domain offline sometimes)\n\nThere'll be more 'mirrors' as this project progresses.\n\nConclusion\n\nGB emu authors, for their hard work on Gameboy (advance) emulation. Especially the sound engine. this is generally everyone..\n\nCreative, for making a good soundcard :P\n\nE-Mu systems, for their Soundfont format\n\nAudio Compositor, for its style of font making.\n\nSonic Foundry, for their UBER-FANTASICO sound editor, Sound Forge.\nGeocities, for at least hosting my FIRST WORKING site.\n\nBeta, for his free hosting service. :P this thing is mirrored you know.\nEmulation, for without it, there wouldn't be any 'console2pc' stuff.\nAnd myself, for having the inginuity and know-how shot of how to get around this crap. This is a solo project.. Technically, not, but all work is done by me. (except the programs and all. :P)\n\nContact\n\nanu comments, give me a buzz at:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Email address protected by JavaScript.\n  Please enable JavaScript to read it.\n\n\n\n\nor try this:\n\n\nAIM: MaliceX21\nY!M: MyScreenJR\nMSN: MaliceX\n\n\nanywhere else: MaliceX (if you can find me HAHAHA)\n\n----------------------------------=END OF README THANK YOU=-----------------------------------------\n",
