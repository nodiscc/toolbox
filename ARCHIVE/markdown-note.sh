#Description: generate a markdown "note"
# attempt to reproduce https://www.dokuwiki.org/plugin:note in markdown.
# Outputs a markdown table (not supported in core markdown, but some markdown implementations allow it)
# allowing to add a "note" in markdown documentation.
# This is a simple 2 columns table with a symbol in the left pane, correspoding to a note type.
# Currently warning, important, tip and note note types are supported.
# This uses fairly common unicode symbol and should work with many common fonts.
# If you find a common font that does not support one of the characters, please report it.
